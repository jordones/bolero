# Building and running

```

To build for production and run, app will run at `localhost:3000`

Dockerfile and terraform config exist and can be used to build/run the app at `localhost:8000`.
Only included here since I was playing with them and wanted to stash the changes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If I connect a db in the future this might come in handy.
